## Project Briefing:
The Flashcard App Project was completed as an assignment for course IMAD5112. The app provides history question in flashcard format in order to test their knowledge on history. I developed the app in Android Studio and Kotlin.

## Aim and Important Feature

**Objective:** It is a designed app with the sole purpose of helping users test their knowledge on history questions

**Key feature:** True or False buttons 

The feature is to generate quick answers which will then let the user know if the answer they chose is true or false.

## Aspects considered for designing the app:

**Key considerations in designing Flashing App are:**

**Simple user experience :** The application was built on easy use and a very talented User Interface.

**Responsiveness:** Modeled to be the best display on many different screens, which is controlled in terms of support for a big list of devices.

**Minimalism:** The appearance is simple and not disorienting for an end-user.

## Problems and How I solved them

During this application development, there were certain problems that arose which delayed the application to take more time to be developed and thus took a long time which was unexpected.

**Challenge:** linking code to diffrent screens

**How i solved it:** Could not rectify it.

**Challenge:** Push and commit the project to GitHub

**How i solved it:** Youtube Video Tutorials were useful in understanding the content

## Future Work

**Below are upcoming feature updates that I think will improve user experience in the app:**

**1:** App reminders should encourage users to keep using the app every day.

**2:** Giving users the ability to save and back up data

**3:** Creating a users' community within the app where they can exchange new suggestions.


These improvements contribute towards making the application more useful and functional.
