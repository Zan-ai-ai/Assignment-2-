Project Briefing:
The Meal Suggestion App Project was completed as an assignment for course IMAD5112. The app gives real-time meal suggestions to the users to consume while they run their busy days. I developed the app in Android Studio and Kotlin.
Aim and Important Feature
Objective: It is a designed app with the sole purpose of helping users with an instantaneous meal suggestion, which they can eat for the rest of the day.
Key feature: Meal Suggestion Generation Button
The feature is to generate quick suggestions so that the user obtains a food suggestion in relation to the time of the day.
Aspects considered for designing the app:
Key considerations in designing Meal Suggestion App are:
Simple user experience : The application was built on easy use and a very talented User Interface.
Responsiveness: Modeled to be the best display on many different screens, which is controlled in terms of support for a big list of devices.
Minimalism: The appearance is simple and not disorienting for an end-user.

Problems and How I solved them
During this application development, there were certain problems that arose which delayed the application to take more time to be developed and thus took a long time which was unexpected.
Challenge: Make code such that the app becomes operational even when the user specifies time of day in lower cases.
How i solved it: Could not rectify it.
Challenge: Push and commit the project to GitHub
How i solved it: Youtube Video Tutorials were useful in understanding the content
Future Work
Below are upcoming feature updates that I think will improve user experience in the app:
1: App reminders should encourage users to keep using the app every day.
2: Giving users the ability to save and back up data
3: Creating a users' community within the app where they can exchange new suggestions.
These improvements contribute towards making the application more useful and functional.
